Hey, I'm Amy. Are you ready to level up your web project?

I'm a web developer based in Ottawa, Canada. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.
